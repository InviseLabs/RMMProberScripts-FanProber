## FanProber: Monitoring of FAN RPM Speeds
##### Part of our [RMMProberScripts](https://github.com/InviseLabs/RMMProberScripts): – A collection of deployable Windows-based command-line scripts designed to warn you of concerning hardware or sensor problems. Each tool outputs the associated raw troubleshooting values, along with a PASS or FAIL and proper exit codes. Use with RMM or IT Admin software to alert you when a script check FAILs.

**FanProber** is an efficient command-line utility designed to monitor and report the workstation's fan speeds. It will output detected fan RPMs and a PASS or FAIL, alerting you to any irregularities, such as **intermittent fan stoppages**—an often-overlooked issue that can lead to critical system overheating.

Despite the expectation that motherboards and BIOS should accurately track these metrics, real-world scenarios often prove otherwise. Over the years, at Invise Solutions, we've encountered business clients that were experiencing sporadic PC crashes. Hands-on investigations revealed that the CPU fan was halting erratically, causing the CPU to overheat, and Windows to BSOD. In these scenarions, the motherboard thermal control firmware failed to recognize or intervene. This tool was born out of the necessity to preemptively identify such failures before they result in hardware damage or system downtime.

Works with any RMM dashboard that supports monitoring command-line output and exit codes. Please read below to understand how this script works before you deploy. You may need to modify the suggested deployment method for your situation. Supports only Windows-based workstations and servers. Read below for more info.
